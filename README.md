# This is my first github repository!

## I am very hungry

I can use markdown to *italicize* and **bold** my text. 

Also, I can [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0i_QkAwCgws) to 
things I find on the internet. 

When I get home I am going to: 
1. Eat my chipotle chips and guac
1. Pet my cat
1. Watch Netflix
1. Go to sleep

```{python}
for i in range(10)
   print i 
```
